            <h1 style="font-size: 28px">Brisbane, Queesnland, Australia</h1>
            <p style="color:dimgrey" title="Info about Brisbane">Brisbane is a beautiful city with many bridges (for instance the Story Bridge) that cross the beutiful Bribane River. <br/> 
                The city also has botanic gardens and tall scycrapers. <br/>
                You can take the CityCat ferries to different places. The ferries are included in the public transport. <br/>
                I like this city because it is very different from my home city. One difference being in the number of inhabitants. <br/>
                In my hometown we have about 60.000 inhabitants whereas in Brisbane there are about 2.3 milloin inhabitants. <br/>
                Some interesting places are Lone Pine Coala Sanctuary, Sea world, Sounth Bank and Mount Coot-Tha. <br/>
                Brisbane is located at the east coast and is close to many places like Surfer's Paradise, The Great Barrier Reef and many islands which might be worth visiting. <br/>
                About 2h's drive from Brisbane is also Cape Byron which is the Most Easterly Point of the Australian Mainland.

                During my carreer i have been working with different programs such as mathlab. <br/>
                Have also tried to learn some languages during my spare time, such as GoLang, C++, Html, CSS and JavaScript. <br/>
                Have also learned some Visual Basic using Excel, and used it during my secondary school education to create simple programs. <br/>
                However, haven't so much experience about development on a professional level. <br/>
